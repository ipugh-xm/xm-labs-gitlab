# How it works
These steps pull from various API endpoints in GitLab to get commit detils.


# Installation

## GitLab Setup
If you are trying to access a public project, then none.

If your project is private, then you will need to authenticate with an API Token.

## xMatters Setup
1. Download the [GitLab.zip](GitLab.zip) file onto your local computer
2. Navigate to the Developer tab of your xMatters instance
